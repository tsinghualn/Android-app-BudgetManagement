# BudgetManagementApplication

Here are some instructions on how to run our application! After you have cloned our repository...
1. Download Android Studio, if you do not already. You can download Android Studio from the following link: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. Open the project titled "BadgerBudget" in Android Studio. You should be able to see the code for our application that we have completed at this point. There are 2 "com.example.badgerbudget" folders, one with just the file "BuildConfig" in it, and the other with our code. You can navigate to the second folder via the path app > java > com.example.badgerbudget. 
3. To build our application, go to Build -> Make Project. This should run without any issues.
4. Now to run our application, you will need an Android Virtual Device (AVD). Follow the instructions located at https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds to create an AVD. 
5. Now, you should be able to hit the green triangle near the top left of the screen in Android Studio, and it can run on the AVD that you created earlier. You should be able to see the first page of our application, but not much else, as are are currently in early development of the application!
6. To see the other UI pages that we have developed but not linked to the application, navigate to the "layout" folder via the following path: app > resources > layout. This will contain xml files that when opened in Android Studio will show you what the other UI pages that we have developed.
